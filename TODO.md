# LSTM Stock Prediction - Implementation Complete

## Task: Implement LSTM AI model predictions for 6 months, 1 month, and 7 days periods

## Steps Completed:
- [x] 1. Backend: Optimized LSTM model for faster predictions

## LSTM Speed Optimizations Applied:
- Reduced epochs from 10 to 5
- Reduced batch_size from 32 to 64 (faster processing)
- Reduced lookback from 30 to 20 days
- Simplified LSTM architecture: 16→8 units
- Reduced early stopping patience from 3 to 2
- Increased training data split from 80% to 85%
